# Introducing Data Types

The information stored in a computer is collectively referred to as data. Data can be expressed in many different ways, which we refer to as ‚Äútypes‚Äù. Each type looks different and has different rules governing its usage.

At the most basic level, computers store data in binary form.

However, this level of data is difficult to read and even harder to program in. Instead, programmers use more abstract forms of data represented in English when reading and writing code. These abstract instructions are then converted into binary by our coding software, which the computer can execute.

# New Data Type: `String`

### Intro - how to make a computer speak English

### What is a string?

A string is a type of data that looks and reads like plain english. Each string contains a collection of characters that can be made up of letters, numbers, and/or punctuation.

Can you figure out how many characters are in this string?

### Strings in Python

In Python, and many other programming languages, strings are enclosed by either single or double quotes. The following are both valid strings.

```python
"Hello"

'Goodbye'
```

Strings can contain letters, numbers, and¬†punctuation.

```python
"123 + 8 = 131"

'Jeff is eight (8) years old!'
```

**A few basic requirements:**

- Strings must start and end with the same ‚Äútype‚Äù of quote

  ```python
  "Hello" # correct

  'Hello" # incorrect
  ```

- Double-quoted strings can only span one line of code.

  ```python
  "Hello my name is Alex" # correct

  ****"Hello my
  name is alex" # incorrect
  ```

- Characters inside a string cannot contain the same type of quote as the type of quote enclosing the entire string. If it does, the interpreter won‚Äôt be able to see where the string is supposed to start and where it is supposed to end.
  ```python
  "He said "goodbye""   # incorrect
  					  # The interpreter sees ‚ÄúHe said ‚Äú and ‚Äú‚Äù as two independent strings.
  "He said 'goodbye'"   # correct.
  					  # We use "" to enclose the string because the string contains ''
  ```

**If you try to execute a program with an incorrectly formatted string, it will not run and Python will display an error message.**

```python
incorrectly_formatted_string = "hello' # our code
# running the code...
# error! we get back the message below:
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    incorrectly_formatted_string = "hello'
                                         ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

### Escape Character

So, what happens when we need to use both kinds of quotation marks in our string?

We can tell the interpreter that a quotation mark is part of a string by writing the backslash ‚Äú\‚Äù before each quotation mark inside the string.

```python
"they said "hello" to james"   # incorrect
"they said \"hello\" to james" # correct
```

‚Äú\‚Äù is known as the ‚Äúescape character‚Äù. The computer treats it differently than all the other characters in the string. If you want to include an escape character in a string, prefix it with another escape character.

```python
"this is an escape character: \"  # incorrect
"this is an escape character: \\" # correct
```

## Exercises:

**Converting to Strings**

```python
# Convert the following data to string format **without deleting anything**
# The code should run once you have done this successfully
