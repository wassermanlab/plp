It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science.‚Äù - Ada Lovelace\n> \n\nAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace for short, was an early 19th century English mathematician and writer. \n\nShe is perhaps best known for her work with the English polymath Charles Babbage on one of the world‚Äôs first computers, called the difference machine, a machine for performing complex mathematical calculations. \n\nAda saw the potential of such a machine to carry out operations beyond numerical calculation and wrote the first computer algorithm for a newer machine called the analytical engine. As a result, she is seen today as the first true computer programmer! \n\n![Part of Charles Babbage‚Äôs Difference Machine](images/440px-Difference_engine_plate_1853.jpg)\n\nPart of Charles Babbage‚Äôs Difference Machine\n\nTake a look at Ada‚Äôs algorithm below. What parts you recognize? How do you think the code is executed? What do you think it‚Äôs purpose is? Her code, written in 1840, is very similar to the modern programs that we write in languages like Python today.\n\n![Ada Lovelace‚Äôs first program](images/Diagram_for_the_computation_of_Bernoulli_numbers-2.jpg)\n\nAda Lovelace‚Äôs first program\n\nNotice that many of the column‚Äôs labels include the word ‚Äúvariable‚Äù. This concept was one of the core ideas of Ada and Babbage‚Äôs work and is a core concept in modern programming.\n\n## What is a variable?\n\nA variable is something that is used to store information.
