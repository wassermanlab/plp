This uses a third-party login. The store doesn’t directly access your PayPal account, but rathersends the purchase order to the PayPal API and PayPal handles the rest of the transaction.\n    \n\n2. **Weather Apps**\n    - Weather forecasts from a Google search or a weather app gather information through the API of any weather service and not from generating data on their own.\n    \n\n3. **Private API examples**\n    - Streaming Services such as Netflix and Spotify have to distribute media to nearly any device. Whether the user is on a Windows PC, an iPad, a smart TV, or something else, there’s an expectation that they’ll be able to stream content. Streaming services get this done with an API, ensuring their content is compatible with any device.\n    \n\n4. **Financial Apps**\n    - Your bank makes use of an internal API to manage all aspects of your finances, from checking and savings accounts to credit cards or CDs. Customer service will require a different set of software than the technical aspects of account management, but these functions need to connect. An API keeps these departments tied together.\n    \n\n**More porject Ideas and resources**: \n\n[here] (https://realpython.com/tutorials/api/)\n[here] (https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/)\n\n",
