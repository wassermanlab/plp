    "\n",
    "- As we approach this module, we’ll be discussing Boolean values, named after George Boole, a famous mathematician who made significant contributions to algebra and logic.\n",
    "- George Boole was born in England in the 1800s, to a typical working class family of not-so-successful cobblers.\n",
    "- Although his family could only afford technical school, George’s love of education led him to consume works of famous mathematicians in his spare time, eventually securing teaching positions and opening his own school at age 19.\n",
    "- George Boole is most known for his paper, 'An Investigation Into the Laws of Thought’, featuring many key concepts of computer science still used today.\n",

    "# The Lightbulb Example 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we flip the switch for a lightbulb in our house, there are usually only two states the light can be in:\n",
    "  - On\n",
    "  - Off\n",
    "- We can’t really say that a light is both on AND off at the same time, right? Even if the light were flickering, it would still be either on or off at different times\n",
    "- There is no way for a light to be both on and off at the same time. Similarly, we can apply this concept to the idea of True and False\n",
    "- In real life, we can say things that might be both True and False, like, “February has 29 days”\n",
    "  - This is both True and False because normally, February has 28 days, unless it is on a leap year, in which case February has 29 days — making the statement True and False\n",
    "- However, in computer science, every statement that is made can only be either True or False. There is no in between, similar to the lightbulb example\n",

    "# New Data Type: Boolean Values\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember in the previous modules, we learned how to assign different values to variables? We could make `x` equal a string, or different number data types like `int` and `float`\n",
    "- A new data type we will be exploring in this module is the Boolean type, written as `bool`\n",
    "- Unlike the other data types, the `bool` type only has two possible values:\n",
    "  - `True`\n",
    "  - `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",

    "  - A variable name\n",
    "  - A value stated as `True` or `False`\n",
    "- The structure for declaring a boolean variable is the same as declaring any other variable, however, unlike strings, since `True` and `False` are special keywords in Python, `bool` variables do not need quotations or apostrophes surrounding the words:"

    "Scenario: You are an electrician. Somebody hires you to wire a new room in their house, which has two connected light switches. This client wants their room wired so **that flipping one of the light switches causes all the lights in the room to flip on or off.** Being the savvy electrician that you are, you decide to first test out your wiring in Python using a boolean expression.\n",

    "- \"My tire pressure is low OR my check-engine light is on OR (NOT my radio works)\" gives a truth value for whether something is wrong with my car."
