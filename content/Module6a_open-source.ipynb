    "# ‚Äú**Don't Reinvent The Wheel**‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "- A popular saying amongst programmers is not to reinvent the wheel, referring to the idea that we shouldn‚Äôt duplicate methods that already exist\n",
    "- In programming, we often reuse code that others have already created, which is offered for free and publicly distributed as ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù resources\n",
    "- We can refer to these code repositories as ‚Äúlibraries‚Äù\n",
    "- You may have heard of other programming languages, such as JavaScript, C, and C++. However, one of Python‚Äôs greatest strengths is that it has large standard library that comes with built-in functions you can use in your own code!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using Libraries: Import Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real world terms, a library is a collection of books that are stored and accessed at your own convenience\n",
    "- Similarly, in programming, a library is a collection of precompiled code that can be used in programs for specific operations\n",
    "- In order to use these libraries, we need to:\n",
    "    1.  `import` the library into the code, so your file understands what to use \n",
    "        - `import` tells the user what the custom statements used mean, otherwise, your computer will not know what certain keywords are referring to because it‚Äôs not built into Python\n",
    "    2.  `install` the library onto your computer\n",
    "- For this module, we will be focusing solely on MatPlotLib, but there are thousands of open-source libraries out there, which is what makes Python such a popular and useful language!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why MatPlotLib?\n",
    "\n",
    "- MatPlotLib is one of the most popular 2D data visualization libraries in Python\n",
    "- It is a tool used to graph data visually, and is actually built on other popular libraries, such as NumPy and SciPi. Think of these different libraries like a tree hierarchy, where the roots (ie. other libraries) are the foundation for some of MatPlotLib‚Äôs functions\n",
    "- Plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and scatterplots are some of the graphs you can make using MatPlotLib"

    "\n",
    "This is a clear example of how correlation does not equal causation. Despite the strong correlation between the number of ice cream sold and shark attacks each month, they are not actually causing one another. A more plausible reason is that during the warmer months, more people are likely to visit the beach and buy ice cream, thus increasing the chances of a shark attack occuring. The confounding variable in this scenario is the climate. \n",
