    "# ‚Äú**Don't Reinvent The Wheel**‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "- A popular saying amongst programmers is not to reinvent the wheel, referring to the idea that we shouldn‚Äôt duplicate methods that already exist\n",
    "- In programming, we often reuse code that others have already created, which is offered for free and publicly distributed as ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù resources\n",
    "- We can refer to these code repositories as ‚Äúlibraries‚Äù\n",
    "- You may have heard of other programming languages, such as JavaScript, C, and C++. However, one of Python‚Äôs greatest strengths is that it has large standard library that comes with built-in functions you can use in your own code!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using Libraries: Import Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real world terms, a library is a collection of books that are stored and accessed at your own convenience\n",
    "- Similarly, in programming, a library is a collection of precompiled code that can be used in programs for specific operations\n",
    "- In order to use these libraries, we need to:\n",
    "    1.  `import` the library into the code, so your file understands what to use \n",
    "        - `import` tells the user what the custom statements used mean, otherwise, your computer will not know what certain keywords are referring to because it‚Äôs not built into Python\n",
    "    2.  `install` the library onto your computer\n",
    "- For this module, we will be focusing solely on MatPlotLib, but there are thousands of open-source libraries out there, which is what makes Python such a popular and useful language!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why MatPlotLib?\n",
    "\n",
    "- MatPlotLib is one of the most popular 2D data visualization libraries in Python\n",
    "- It is a tool used to graph data visually, and is actually built on other popular libraries, such as NumPy and SciPi. Think of these different libraries like a tree hierarchy, where the roots (ie. other libraries) are the foundation for some of MatPlotLib‚Äôs functions\n",
    "- Plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and scatterplots are some of the graphs you can make using MatPlotLib ![MatPlotLib Graphs](images/Untitled.png)"

    "# Example 1: Creating A Basic Bar Graph üìä\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar graphs help to visualize trends and patterns in categorical data\n",
    "    - Some examples of bar graphs might be:\n",
    "        - The number of red, blue, and yellow marbles in a jar\n",
    "        - The favorite ice cream flavour of students in a class of 30\n",
    "        - The number of male and female graduating students for each bachelor‚Äôs degree\n",
    "- Let‚Äôs begin creating our own bar graph using the example code below!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "- Copy this code into your IDE and run the code to see what happens"

    "- Abstraction in Python is when unecessary information or parts of code is hidden from the user, essentially running in the background\n",
    "- We don‚Äôt always need to know what each line of code does in order to use an already existing function, especially when the function is complex and long\n",

    "# Unit Project ‚Äî Do Sharks Eat Ice Cream?  ü¶à\n",
    "\n",
    "After the fifth recorded shark attack on Beach Newport, you were contacted by John, a lifeguard that works at the beach, to conduct an investigation into the incident. Once there, you noticed the sheer amount of ice cream stalls located around the perimeter of the beach üèñÔ∏è. \n",
    "\n",
    "John comes up to you and says: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy. They were all just eating ice cream and having fun before they got attacked!‚Äù Thinking to yourself that this is a most peculiar coincidence, you decide to collect data on the number of ice cream sales and the number of shark attacks that occurred each month throughout the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if, you thought, sharks were being baited by the beachgoers‚Äô irresistable ice cream¬†treats üç¶? After a year of fruitful investigation, this is the data that you‚Äôve gathered:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Month | # of ice cream sales | # of shark attacks |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| January | 8 | 0 |\n",
    "| February | 10 | 0 |\n",
    "| March | 11 | 1 |\n",
    "| April | 14 | 1 |\n",
    "| May | 20 | 2 |\n",
    "| June | 50 | 4 |\n",

    "| December | 5 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your newly gained knowledge of MatPlotLib, you are going to find out whether there is any basis to the correlation that you‚Äôve made between ice cream and sharks. Do sharks just enjoy ice cream ü§î? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What sort of plot/graph would represent this data most effectively?\n",
    "- Note how there are now two variables we need to plot ‚Äî the number of ice cream sold and the number of shark attacks\n",
    "    - How can we distinguish between the two sets of data clearly (think of colours, markers, legends, text size, etc.)?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "You print out your graph and eagerly rush down to Beach Newport to inform John of your conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your graph, what news do you bring to him? Choose one of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sharks eat ice cream üòé\n",
    "2. Sharks are lactose intolerant üòî¬†\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clear example of how correlation does not equal causation. Despite the strong correlation between the number of ice cream sold and shark attacks each month, they are not actually causing one another. A more plausible reason is that during the warmer months, more people are likely to visit the beach and buy ice cream, thus increasing the chances of a shark attack occuring. The confounding variable in this scenario is the climate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although graphs appear objective at first, it is important to keep in mind that they can be manipulated and may not represent the full picture!"
