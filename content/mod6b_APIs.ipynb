    "# b. More Libraries: APIs and Console Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "# Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Refresher on Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- We learned in the previous module that libraries are abstracted code that others have created, which are meant to be reusable and have easily understandable functions\n",
    "- Libraries are interesting because we don‚Äôt necessarily need to understand exactly how a function works ‚Äî what is important is knowing how to use it, and its resulting output\n",
    "- Libraries can be used together simultaneously with other libraries, including the standard libraries built into Python to create something entirely new\n",
    "- In this module, we will be demonstrating how we can use different libraries and their pre-built functions to create a simple game, and even create our own unique twist!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revisiting Previous Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- This game tutorial assumes you have already completed the previous modules, and will require your understanding on how the following is implemented and used:\n",
    "    - loop statements\n",
    "    - conditional statements\n",
    "    - user-defined functions\n",
    "    - import statements\n",
    "- You will also be learning to incorporate libraries through the use of something called an API, which will be explained in the next section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Libraries: API Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API** stands for ‚ÄúApplication Programming Interface‚Äù which can be thought of as a way to communicate between two applications using each other‚Äôs requests and responses\n",
    "    - For example, think of a restaurant setting. The menu provides you with a list of food options, the waiter will take your request and send it to the kitchen, and the kitchen will process that request. The waiter in this case is comparable to an API.\n",
    "    - An API is essentially a software intermediary that allows two different applications to communicate with each other\n",
    "- APIs typically have a way to `GET` information, `DELETE`, `POST`, and `PATCH` information ‚Äî these are the standard request conventions for most APIs\n",
    "    - For our purposes and to simplify this module, we will only be focusing on `GET` requests, which means we will be using an API call to `GET` certain kinds of information for us to use\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Project: Creating a Wordle-Esque Game  üí¨\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this module, we will have you follow along to create your own (terminal) console-based word guessing game, similar to the popular ‚ÄòWordle‚Äô phone game!\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a word-guessing game where a random 5 letter word is generated, and the user has a limited number of turns to guess the word. We recommend taking a few minutes to [play the game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) to understand how it works!\n",
    "    - If a correct letter is guessed in the correct spot, it will appear green\n",
    "    - If a correct letter is guessed in the wrong spot, it will appear yellow\n",
    "    - If an incorrect letter is guessed, it will appear grey\n",
    "    - The game ends when:\n",
    "        - the user has correctly guessed the word, with all letters in the correct spots, or\n",
    "        - the user has made 6 incorrect guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "![Untitled](b%20More%20Libraries%20APIs%20and%20Console%20Applications%20e30e876b76a64d1baaac016ca43d926e/Untitled.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since we will be creating this on the terminal‚Äôs console, we don‚Äôt have the option to use colour at the moment to signify correct spots, so instead, we‚Äôll be modifying our game a bit to still have a similar functionality\n",
    "- Before we begin writing code, the most important part of creating software is to plan out and understand the steps we need to take to get to the end result of a working game\n",
    "- We need to identify what questions to ask and what steps to take in what order ‚Äî which we can do by brainstorming some questions:\n",
    "    - **What are we trying to build?**\n",
    "    - **What should our game do?**\n",
    "    - **What are the steps to get our game to work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try to think about how you would answer these questions on your own if you were to build a Wordle game. Once you‚Äôve thought about it, move on to the next step where we‚Äôll try to brainstorm some solutions\n",
    "    - Think about each step needed to build a guessing game and how we can determine if someone‚Äôs guess is correct or incorrect\n",
    "    - **Thinking and planning is key to becoming an efficient programmer!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Planning: Identifying Our Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let‚Äôs try to resolve each question in depth so we understand exactly how to tackle this game and have a good plan for where to start:\n",
    "- **What are we trying to build?**\n",
    "    - We will be building a Wordle-esque game where the user will be guessing a random 5 letter word and be told if they guessed a correct letter in the correct spot, a correct letter in an incorrect spot, or an incorrect letter\n",
    "    - Since we cannot use the colour system that Wordle originally uses, we will need to brainstorm or search for a different method, but *this will be done as an added feature later* on ‚Äî for now, it‚Äôs most important to get the base game to work\n",
    "    - The game will end after 6 incorrect turns or a correct word guess\n",
    "- **What should our game do?**\n",
    "    - Our game will need to generate a random 5 letter word\n",
    "    - Our game will need to allow the player to guess 5 letter words ‚Äî no more or less\n",
    "    - Our game will need to determine if the player‚Äôs answer is correct\n",
    "    - Our game will need to keep track of the number of attemps, and end after 6 incorrect guesses or if a correct guess was made before the 6th turn\n",
    "- **What are the steps to get our game to work?**\n",
    "    - Building off of our goals for the game in the previous question, we can expand further on the steps we need to take to get our base game to work ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry about fancy features for now, what‚Äôs most important is going through each step and brainstorming some code so we get a better sense of how to begin building our game.\n",
    "    - *Our game will need to generate a random 5 letter word*\n",
    "        - We need to figure out a way to get random 5 letter words that are real dictionary words; in this case, our best bet would most likely be to find and use a free `API`\n",
    "    - *Our game will need to allow the player to guess 5 letter words ‚Äî no more or less*\n",
    "        - We need an `input` statement to let the player enter their guesses\n",
    "        - We need to write an `if` condition to check that the player has only inputted words that are 5 letters, and reject their word otherwise\n",
    "    - *Our game will need to determine if the player‚Äôs answer is correct*\n",
    "        - We need to check the player‚Äôs guess each time to see if it matches the random word generated earlier, which will use an `if` condition to return `True` if correct\n",
    "    - *Our game will need to keep track of the turns, and end after 6 incorrect guesses or a correct guess before the 6th turn*\n",
    "        - We need a counter to keep track of how many incorrect guesses the player has made, and automatically `exit` the game when they have reached 6\n",
    "        - We need to `exit` the game when the player has guessed the correct answer\n",
    "        - We need to make sure the invalid guesses (not 5 letter words) are not counted towards the turn counter\n",
    "- Now that we have a plan for the most basic aspects of the gameplay, we need to begin figuring out how to implement these steps; [Google](http://google.ca/) will be your best friend when you‚Äôre stuck on something or you experience a strange error!\n",
    "    - If you are stuck or are experiencing any issues in the coding, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact our TAs, we will be happy to assist you! üòä\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Implementation: Putting Our Steps to Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before we start, we will need to create a new project in our `IDE` to hold the code and libraries that we will be putting in, you can name it anything you‚Äôd like or use `guessingGame`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating A Random 5-Letter Word\n",

    "</aside>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a look at [this free and open-source API](https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/) that can generate a random dictionary word\n",
    "    - This `API` allows single and multiple random words to be generated, along with specific `parameters` that can be added to specify word length, commonality, and other filters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random-Word API: Install and Import\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to use this API, we will need to install the library package in order to use its functions\n",
    "    - Copy and paste  `sudo pip3 install random-word` in your terminal and to install the packages\n",
    "    - When completed, this will create a random_word folder under your project‚Äôs libraries that will allow you to use these already defined functions\n",
    "    - We will not be concerned about how the library‚Äôs functions are implemented, rather, we will be focusing on the documentation provided on the [API‚Äôs website](https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/) to understand how to use these functions and its parameters\n",
    "- In order to use the libraries‚Äô functions in our code, we will need to create a new python file, which you can name `guessingGame.py` then copy this code as the first line:"
