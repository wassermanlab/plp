    "    - For example, think of a restaurant setting. The menu provides you with a list of food options, the waiter will take your request and send it to the kitchen, and the kitchen will process that request. The waiter in this case is comparable to an API.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `Debugging` your code, also known as quality assurance (QA) is an **extremely important** part of programming - we want our code to be as predictable as possible before moving onto adding more advanced features\n",
    "- We can always add code on top, but every time we do this, we make it much more difficult to fix issues that previously existed since it is harder to pinpoint where the error is coming from\n",
    "    - Sometimes new code we add does not work as intended because of the existing issues\n",
    "    - You can see how it might be difficult to determine if the error lies in our new code or in our existing code ‚Äî that is why it is important to make sure we check for any bugs beforehand\n",
    "- Were you able to find any bugs in the previous exercise? Don‚Äôt be upset if your code isn‚Äôt working as intended sometimes, it‚Äôs pretty rare to be able to get your code perfect the first time\n",
    "- There are situations called `edge cases` which are unlikely circumstances that happen, that a programmer might not have anticipated ‚Äî these are the cases where bugs occur most often\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning to Read Error Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding the error messages in the console is another important skill in programming ‚Äî in fact, you can solve majority of problems as long as you understand certain pieces of information\n",
    "- One of the most valuable pieces of information is the **line number** that is given\n",
    "    - This is the line the error occurs, and your first source of inspection when dealing with bugs\n",
    "- The other valuable piece is the **error name** that is given\n",
    "    - Even if you don‚Äôt quite understand what the name means, it gives you a key word that you can google and find further information on\n",
    "- One thing to note is that you don‚Äôt necessarily need to solve errors in order. You can try tackling easier ones first!\n",
