Have you ever paid x.xxxx amount?\n- Then try to value `$0`. You’ll notice that it only has one decimal place, but what if we wanted to keep it to two decimal places?\n- Lets ensure that our total cost is rounded to two decimal places and has exactly two decimal places using the `str.format()` built-in function.
